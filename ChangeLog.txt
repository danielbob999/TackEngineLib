#TackEngineLib Update Notes

##Update 1.3
###Known Issues:
- The SpriteSheet class so fucking broken

###Changes:
- Changed out the Sprite class holds data.
	> Data is now stored in a byte array (representing RGBA values)
	> If you need the Sprite in a Bitmap format, called GetBitmapCopy(). Don't forget to dispose of the Bitmap after you are done!
- Added a SpriteAtlas class.
- Updated TackConsole
	> All alog messages are now appended to a log file when the engine closes
	> Logging to file can be enabled/disabled
